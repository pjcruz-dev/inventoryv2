# 🔍 Validation-Only Feature Guide

## 🎯 Overview
Your import system has built-in validation that runs **before** importing data to the database. This ensures data integrity and prevents errors.

## 🚀 How to Use Validation-Only Feature

### **Method 1: Through Web Interface (Recommended)**

1. **🌐 Open your browser** and go to: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/import-export/interface`
2. **🔐 Login** with your credentials
3. **📁 Select Module:** Choose "users" (or any module)
4. **⚡ Select Action:** Choose "Import Data"
5. **📤 Upload File:** Select your CSV file
6. **🔍 Click "Next"** - The system will automatically validate first
7. **📊 View Results:** You'll see validation results before any database import

### **Method 2: Using Validation Endpoint Directly**

You can use the dedicated validation endpoint:

```bash
POST /import-export/validate/users
```

**Parameters:**
- `file`: Your CSV file
- `_token`: CSRF token

### **Method 3: Add Validation-Only Checkbox (Custom Enhancement)**

To add a "Validate Only" checkbox to the interface, you can modify the form:

```html
<div class="form-check mb-3">
    <input class="form-check-input" type="checkbox" id="validate-only" name="validate_only">
    <label class="form-check-label" for="validate-only">
        <i class="fas fa-search me-1"></i> Validate Only (Don't Import to Database)
    </label>
</div>
```
